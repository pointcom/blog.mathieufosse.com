title: Another attempt to maintain a blog
---

For those who knows me, they know this is not my first attempt to create
a blog. Create a blog is not a big deal. It took me only a couple of hours
to find a [blog platform](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and to create a simple theme. No, what's really
difficult is to maintain it. 

So one more time I try to maintain a blog and to make more difficult I chose to write up my blog posts in english. 
Indeed I am french.
I hope this blog should help someone. 
Even if it won't help someone I hope it will help me at least to take note and improve my english.

So "Bienvenu" on my brand new blog. I will speak about all the things I love. 
Essentially Web development and startup.
